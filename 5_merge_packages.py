# Given a package with a weight limit limit and an array of integers items of where each integer represents the weight of an item, implement a function merge_packages that finds the first two items in the items array whose sum of weights equals the given weight limit limit.

# Your function should return a pair[i, j] of the indices of the item weights, ordered such that i > j. If such a pair doesnâ€™t exist, return an empty array.

# Examples:

# Input: items = [4, 6, 10, 15, 16], limit = 21
# Output: [3, 1]
# Explanation: The weight of the items at indices 3 and 1 sum up to the specified limit.

# [execution time limit] 4 seconds(py3)

# [input] array.integer items

# A list of item weights.

# [input] integer limit

# The weight limit we're aiming for by merging two packages.

# [output] array.integer

# A pair of item indices indicating the two items that, when merged, reach the specified limit.

# SOLUTION
items = [4, 6, 10, 15, 16]
limit = 21

            # -2 = 1 - 3 => -2: 2
            # and save the difference as the key on the hashtable
            # and the index as the value
            diff[difference] = index

# Space Complexity -> O(n)
